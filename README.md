**What does this code do?**<br/>
This code pulls the NAV data for all mutual funds directly from the AMFI website.
The URL for the same is - 'https://www.amfiindia.com/spages/NAVAll.txt'
This code will extract only the Scheme Name, NAV and Date data from the website. It will then save this data into a new excel file named 'AMFI NAV'.
